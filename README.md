# Pattys-Cakes
My name is Mrs Pat Cake. I own a bakery called "To Pie For". I need to move with the times and therefore 
require an e-commerce web site built for me. This will provide my customers online shopping facilities from 
their homes and workplace. Very important for me during this COVID-19 period. Here are some of my 
requirements.
Any potential customer must be able to sign up for free. Upon registration they will need to enter their name, 
contact number, email address and a potential delivery address. Once signed up, they should be able to log in 
to their account and browse all my awesome, delicious products they may want to purchase as their interest is 
piqued. 
Once on the site, a customer should be able to select a category of products they would like to browse. For 
instance, cookies, cakes and cupcakes, fresh breads, pastries, pies, and brownies. As the customer browses,
they should be able to view prices and details of any selected items. These details must include any warnings 
(e.g.: contains nuts) as well as nutrient information and ingredients contained in the product. 
Should the customer want to purchase a product, they will need to select it and then place it into their
shopping cart. The customer must be able to continue to shop for more items after placing an item into the 
shopping cart. Once completed with their shopping, the customer should proceed to the ‘checkout’. 
At checkout time, all items placed in their shopping cart, along with the total amount to be paid is displayed as 
“order ready” to the customer. Should the customer not want to continue with the order and cancel the process 
(s)he should be able to do so. An option of being able to edit the order must be available before a customer 
makes a final acceptance.
If (s)he proceeds with accepting the order, more information is required to complete the transaction. The 
customer will be asked to fill an e-form providing information about the shipping address or confirm a delivery 
address previously used. They will also be required to select a payment option such as credit/debit card or 
EFT (incidentally, you do not have to implement a payment gateway, just create a ‘stub’ that will randomly 
accept and reject payments). 
Once an order is placed, an email notification must be sent to the customer acknowledging the order request. 
For verification, the user must be e-mailed a copy of the shopping receipt after a successful payment 
transaction.
